\section{Conclusion}

This work establishes the abstraction relationship between PH, which is more abstract and allows incomplete knowledge on cooperations, and Thomas' approach for qualitative BRN modeling.
This motivates the concretization of PH models into a set of compatible Thomas' models in order to benefit of the complementary advantages of these two formal frameworks and extract some global information about the influences between components.

As an extensions of the presented work, we now plan to explore new semantics of BRNs that would be able to tackle with influences currently represented by unsigned edges.

In order to improve the performances in the IG inference, we will also consider projection operations on
the PH structure to undo cooperations between components and reduce the cardinality of
configurations to explore.
